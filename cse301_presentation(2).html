                            <p><strong>Kingstar Restaurant</strong> is a leading food restaurant in Bangladesh. It is established in 2021. The restaurant is situated at Tilagor, Sylhet, Bangladesh. Basically, this restaurant sells many delicious and spicy food both offline and online. The restaurants range from inexpensive and informal lunching or dining places catering to people working nearby, with modest food served in simple settings at low prices, to expensive establishments serving refined food in a formal setting. In the former case, customers usually wear casual clothing. In the latter case, depending on culture and local traditions, customers might wear semi-casual, semi-formal or formal wear. Typically, at mid to high-priced restaurants, customers sit at tables, their orders are taken by a waiter, who brings the food when it is ready. After eating, the customers then pay the bill. In some restaurants, such as workplace cafeterias, there are no waiters; the customers use trays, on which they place cold items that they select from a refrigerated container and hot items which they request from cooks, and then they pay a cashier before they sit down. Another restaurant approach which uses few waiters is the buffet restaurant. Customers serve food onto their own plates and then pay at the end of the meal. Buffet restaurants typically still have waiters to serve drinks. Fast food restaurants are also considered a restaurant. In addition, food trucks are another popular option for people who want quick food service.
